Changes were not committed
So we implemented some fixes
- remove references/commit hashes (because the week2-exercise-1 folder was cloned from another repo)

@KaiquanMah ➜ /workspaces/utu-tools-for-programming (main) $ rm -rf week-2-exercise-1/.git
@KaiquanMah ➜ /workspaces/utu-tools-for-programming (main) $ git rm --cached week-2-exercise-1









Then we commit our changes again
@KaiquanMah ➜ /workspaces/utu-tools-for-programming (main) $ git add week-2-exercise-1/
